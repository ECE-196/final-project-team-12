Tested wireless sending 47 elements array from one ESP32 to another ESP32 (The Screen). The lidar generates 47 hexadecimal bytes representing distance and angle. So this essentially means I am now able to send all lidar data to the screen.

Figured out how to display on screen using lvgl and ESP_Display Module, will be working on screen buffer. A screen buffer allows it to update data and refresh it in a high fps.
